# Optimized Nginx Configuration for Frontend

# Note: This file is included within the 'http' block of the main nginx.conf in alpine-nginx.
# If you want to change worker_processes, you usually need to do it in the main nginx.conf,
# but for personal projects, the default is often fine or we can rely on the Docker environment.
